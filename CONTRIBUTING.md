## Skill Structure

Each skill follows this structure:

```
skills/skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: Main skill file with YAML frontmatter
└── references/           # Optional: Supporting documentation
    ├── guide-one.md
    └── guide-two.md
```

### SKILL.md Requirements

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: What this skill does and when Claude should use it. Include trigger phrases.
---

# Skill Title

Brief introduction.

## Section One

Content with code examples...
```

**Frontmatter rules:**

- `name`: lowercase with hyphens, max 64 characters
- `description`: max 1024 characters, include trigger phrases

### Code Example Standards

All PHP code must follow [WordPress PHP Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/):

```php
// ✅ GOOD: WordPress coding standards
$query = new WP_Query(
    array(
        'post_type'      => 'post',
        'posts_per_page' => 10,
        'no_found_rows'  => true,
    )
);

if ( $query->have_posts() ) {
    while ( $query->have_posts() ) {
        $query->the_post();
        // Process post.
    }
}
wp_reset_postdata();
```

Key standards:

- Spaces inside parentheses: `function_name( $arg )`
- Use `array()` not `[]` for arrays
- Yoda conditions: `if ( true === $value )`
- Snake_case for variables and functions
- Prefix custom functions: `prefix_function_name()`

### Severity Levels

Use consistent severity labels:

| Level | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| **CRITICAL** | Will cause failures at scale (OOM, 500 errors, DB locks) |
| **WARNING** | Degrades performance under load |
| **INFO** | Optimization opportunity, nice-to-have |

### Comment Style

```php
// ❌ BAD: Description of the problem.
bad_code_example();

// ✅ GOOD: Description of the solution.
good_code_example();
```

## Creating a New Skill

1. **Create the directory structure**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p skills/wp-your-skill/references
   ```

2. **Create SKILL.md** with proper frontmatter and content.

3. **Add references** if the skill needs supporting documentation.

4. **Update marketplace.json** to include the new skill:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "wp-your-skill",
     "source": "./skills/wp-your-skill",
     "description": "Brief description of what it does"
   }
   ```

5. **Update README.md** to list the new skill in the table.

6. **Test thoroughly** before submitting.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your code follows** the standards above.

2. **Update documentation** if you've changed functionality.

3. **Add a changelog entry** in CHANGELOG.md under "Unreleased".
